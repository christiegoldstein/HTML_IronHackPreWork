			<h2>Step Brothers</h2>
			<p>
				Step Brothers is a comedy that came to theaters in 2008. Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly play two middle-aged men who become forced to live together as step brothers when their parents got married. Both Ferell (Brennan) and Reilly (Dale) both lived at home prior to their parents engangement so the movie focuses on how these grown men still behave in childish ways. Brennan and Dale get in numerous arguments and fights which ultimately lead to their parents forcing them to interview for jobs to get them out of the house. Do to their lack of stills, both men were unsuccessful in the interview process. When the boys finally realize they have more in common then they originally thought, they decided to come together to form a business called "Prestige Worldwide."
